## Description

This application makes it convenient and quick for a user to find a nearby doctor to treat a particular medical condition.  The application utilizes the Better Doctor API in the JSON format https://developer.betterdoctor.com/. (Sign Up for your own API key to test this app, and follow the setup instructions below to create a .env file).  

The application is written in JavaScript and its dependencies are conveniently managed by Node Package Manager and Bower.  It can be run via a development server and uses a Gulp based asset pipeline which includes concatenation, minification, browserify, live reloading, build and clean (delete) tasks, and automatic updates of js (vendor.min.js) and css (vendor.css) files through Bower dependencies.
